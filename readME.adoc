.Description of the project
We will read the value of the photoresistor, then have a function called based
off the value of the photoresistor. As the light that the photoresistor receives
goes up the resistance goes down, but the voltage goes up. This is how we will
make the decisions to call the right function to turn on the right color of LED.

.Items Needed
* One 5k Ohm resistor
* Two 330 Ohm resistors
* One Red LED
* One Green LED
* One Photoresistor
* One Arduino R3 
* One Breadboard
* Nine jumper wires

.Circuit Design
On the breadboard I installed one of the photoresistor's leg at column 15 (Note:
the photoresistor has no polarity) and the leg to column 17. I installed the left 
leg of the 5k ohm resistor into column 17 and the other into column 21. I installed
one leg of the 330 Ohm resistor into column 35 and the other leg into column 25 on 
the other side of the ditch. I installed one of the legs of the other 330 Ohm 
resistor into column 40 and the other leg into column 20 on the other side of the
ditch. I installed the anode (long leg) of the green LED into column 25 (same as the
330 Ohm leg column) and the cathode (shorter leg) into column 24. I then installed
the red LED anode (long leg) into column 20 (the same as the other 330 Ohm resistor)
and the cathode (shorter leg) into column 19 Now it is time to run the jumper wires. 
I ran the GND from the Arduino R3 GND to the GND rail. Jumper wire from pin 2 on the
Arduino to column 35 (the same as the 330 Ohm leg). Jumper wire 5V on the Arduino to
column 15 (the same as the photoresistor leg). Jumper wire from pin A0 on the Arduino
to column 17 (the same as the 5k Ohm resistor leg). I ran jumper wire from pin 4 on
the Arduino to column 40 (same as one of the legs of the 330 Ohm resistor). I ran 
jumper wire from GND on rail to column 21 and column 24 on the other side of the 
ditch and to column 19 on the other side of the ditch. I had to jump to the right 
side of the board on the GND rail with a jumper wire to feed to the right side of
the board GND rail. This should close the circuit.

.Code
The code for this project is in the file called "Photoresistor.ino".

.What To Expect
Once the code is done and you upload to the Arduino, you are ready to see which LED
light will light up. If your shop room has good lighting the green LED should light.
Now take your finger and place it over the photoresistor, the closer you put it 
towards the photoresistor the less light it can receive. This will increase the
resistance of the photoresistor, which in turn will decrease the voltage and current.
Our code will read this decrease in voltage and tell our redLED() to turn on the red
LED. Now, when you move your finger away from the photoresistor, more light can make
contact with the resistor and cause the resistance to decrease, while the voltage
and current to increase. This will tell the greenLED() to run. This little project
can be a great starting point to have the circuit power something when the light 
outside is low or when it is high. Have fun with it and make something!
